CDN/SDN check - This is to ensure that both CDN and SDN don't get the same value during scan. This may potentially cause TetraMax issues.

Scan clock gating in occ - This has to be done to ensure that the CP pins of the clock chain registers are clock gated using the SE. We are not explicitly instantiating clock gates.

Adjacent fill option should be used for shift power reduction:RadioButton:Compulsory:Yes:Yes,No:To Be Done:To Be Done:INCORRECT
-shift_power_effort switch needs to be used to reduce power:RadioButton:Compulsory:Yes:Yes,No:To Be Done:To Be Done:INCORRECT
Capture power effort high should be used along with slightly increased power budget. The power budget is got from report_clocks gating  option in TMAX:RadioButton:Compulsory:Yes:Yes,No:To Be Done:To Be Done:INCORRECT
